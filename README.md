Insta Clone Database Analysis (SQL): 


This project explores a insta clone database to uncover user trends and inform marketing strategies.


-- Data Source
The data for this project is contained in a separate text file named InstaCloneDatabase.txt. This file includes SQL statements for creating the database tables and populating them with sample data.

-- Important Note:
Do not directly run scripts from downloaded files. Downloaded files might contain malicious code.
To safely set up the database:

Open the instaCloneDatabase.txt file and copy the entire SQL code.
Paste the copied code into your SQL workbench (like MySQL Workbench or phpMyAdmin).
Highlight the entire code and run it (usually with a lightning bolt symbol) to execute the statements line by line. This will create the database and populate it with sample data.
